# ChainGuard

## Description

ChainGuard is a robust and efficient security framework written in Rust, designed to enhance the integrity and safety of blockchain applications. It provides a suite of tools and libraries for detecting vulnerabilities, enforcing security policies, and monitoring blockchain activity. ChainGuard helps developers build more secure and reliable blockchain solutions by offering pre-emptive security measures and real-time threat detection. It aims to minimize potential exploits and safeguard valuable assets within the blockchain ecosystem.

## Features

*   **Smart Contract Vulnerability Scanner:** Analyzes smart contracts for common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and timestamp dependencies, providing detailed reports and remediation suggestions.
*   **Transaction Anomaly Detection:** Monitors blockchain transactions for suspicious patterns and anomalies, alerting users to potential fraudulent activities or security breaches. This uses statistical analysis and machine learning models to identify deviations from normal behavior.
*   **Access Control Enforcement:** Implements fine-grained access control policies to restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities within the blockchain application, preventing unauthorized modifications and data breaches.
*   **Real-time Monitoring and Alerting:** Provides a dashboard for real-time monitoring of blockchain activity and security events, with configurable alerts for critical issues and potential threats.
*   **Security Policy Engine:** Allows developers to define and enforce custom security policies tailored to their specific blockchain application, ensuring compliance with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

## Installation

To install ChainGuard, you will need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can download Rust from the official website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ChainGuard uses several external crates. You can install them using Cargo:
    
    This command will download and compile all the necessary dependencies.

3. **Install the ChainGuard command-line interface (CLI) (optional):**

    If ChainGuard provides a CLI, you can install it for easier interaction:
    
    Make sure that your `~/.cargo/bin` directory is in your `PATH` environment variable.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use ChainGuard's functionalities:

1.  **Smart Contract Vulnerability Scanning:**

    Assuming you have a smart contract file named `contract.sol`, you can use the vulnerability scanner as follows:

    

2.  **Transaction Anomaly Detection:**

    This example demonstrates how to use the anomaly detection module to analyze a transaction:

    

3.  **Access Control Enforcement:**

    This example shows how to enforce access control policies:
