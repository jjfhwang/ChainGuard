# ChainGuard

## Description

ChainGuard is a Rust-based project focused on implementing secure, decentralized ledger protocols and cryptographic primitives. The goal is to provide a robust and auditable foundation for building decentralized applications and systems that require strong security guarantees. ChainGuard aims to offer a collection of well-tested and formally verified cryptographic tools, making it easier for developers to incorporate secure solutions into their projects without needing to be cryptographic experts. This project emphasizes correctness, performance, and maintainability, adhering to best practices in Rust development and security engineering.

## Features

*   **Secure Hashing Algorithms:** Implementation of various cryptographic hash functions, including SHA-256, SHA-3, and BLAKE3, optimized for performance and security. These implementations are rigorously tested against known test vectors and are designed to be resistant to common attacks.
*   **Digital Signature Schemes:** Support for elliptic curve-based digital signature algorithms like ECDSA and EdDSA, providing secure authentication and data integrity. Key generation, signing, and verification processes are implemented with a focus on preventing side-channel attacks.
*   **Consensus Protocols:** Implementation of a simplified version of a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol, enabling the creation of fault-tolerant distributed ledgers. This protocol provides mechanisms for achieving agreement among a set of nodes, even in the presence of malicious actors.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Support for foundational ZKP protocols, allowing for privacy-preserving computations and verifiable data without revealing the underlying information. Currently implements a simplified version of a SNARK for demonstrating basic arithmetic operations.
*   **Cryptographic Primitives:** Provides a suite of essential cryptographic building blocks, including symmetric encryption algorithms (e.g., AES), key derivation functions (KDFs), and random number generators (RNGs).

## Installation

To install and use ChainGuard, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you don't have them already, you can download them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    

2.  **Build the project:**

    

3.  **Run tests:**

    

4.  **Install the library (optional):**

    

**Dependencies:**

ChainGuard relies on several external crates for specific functionalities. These dependencies are automatically managed by Cargo. The core dependencies include:

*   `ring`: For low-level cryptographic operations.
*   `rand`: For generating random numbers.
*   `serde` and `serde_derive`: For serialization and deserialization (optional, for data structures).

## Usage

Here are a few examples demonstrating how to use different components of the ChainGuard library:

**1. Hashing:**



**2. Digital Signatures (ECDSA):**



**3. Simplified Consensus (Example):**



**Note:** These code snippets are simplified examples.  Refer to the crate's documentation and tests for more detailed usage instructions and error handling best practices.  The `chinguard` prefix should be replaced with the actual name of the crate you build.
